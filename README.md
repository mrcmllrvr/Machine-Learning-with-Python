# Machine-Learning-with-Python-Final-Project
Practiced machine learning models such as:
- Linear Regression
- KNN
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- SVM

then evaluated the models using:
- Accuracy Score
- Jaccard Index
- F1-Score
- LogLoss
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- R2-Score
